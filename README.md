# PasswordManager
A Password Manager made for school project

This password manager has following functions:
1) Add passwords
2) Generate Random Passwords
3) Has custom made encryption function (Thus it is not perfect also...)

This program uses mysql to store password. Thus, to run this on your machine, you need to have MySQL and Python-MySQL connector installed.
Make sure to download all the files in the same folder and run Project.py on your system.
